\section{Methods and Procedure}

A Mixed Strategy Game within this paper refers to a subset of strategic games within game theory. A game is defined to have $P$ players and $M$ moves per player. Each player can play any one of their $M$ moves every round, and scores for each player are calculated by accessing the payoff matrix with the results of all their opponents. The payoff matrix is represented by a $P$-dimensional hypercube matrix with side length $M$. Players can be conceptualized as being arranged in a circle, each player is the first in their perspective, which increments for player to their right. Thus, player $P_i$'s' $(1\leq i\leq P)$ score is calculated by accessing the payoff matrix with the coordinates $(P_i, P_{i+1}, \cdots , P_P, P_1, P_2, \cdots , P_{i-1})$.

Figure \ref{fig:1} shows an example of how payoffs could be calculated for each player. Players $1$ and $2$ make moves $P_1$ and $P_2$, respectively. Thus, the players will recieve scores $M_{<1,2>}=3$ and $M_{<2,1>}=3$, respectively.
